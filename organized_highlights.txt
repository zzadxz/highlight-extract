  Pink Highlights:
    - The caffeinated spider spun a strangely cubist and utterly ineffective web, with
oblique angles, openings big enough to let small birds through, and completely
lacking in symmetry or a center. (The web was far more fanciful than the ones
spun by spiders given cannabis or LSD.)
    - sharpening minds that had been fogged by alcohol, freeing people from the
natural rhythms of the body and the sun, thus making possible whole new kinds of
work and, arguably, new kinds of thought, too
    - Actually, we don’t know whether the bees feel anything when they ingest
caffeine, only that the chemical helps them to remember—which, as we will see,
caffeine appears to do for us, too. Subsequent experiments with bigger budgets
and more elaborate setups, involving fake flowers in more naturalistic settings,
have replicated Wright’s discovery: bees will remember and return more reliably
to flowers that offer them caffeinated nectar
    - Hard as it is to imagine, Western civilization was innocent of coffee or tea
until the 1600s; as it happens, coffee, tea, and chocolate (which also contains
caffeine) arrived in England during the same decade—the 1650s—so we can gain
some idea of the world before caffeine and after
    - kahve, which, loosely translated, means “wine of Araby.”
    - Continues Michelet: “Coffee, the sober drink, the mighty nourishment of the
brain, which unlike other spirits, heightens purity and lucidity; coffee, which
clears the clouds of the imagination and their gloomy weight; which illumines
the reality of things suddenly with the flash of truth.” To see, lucidly, “the
reality of things”: this was, in a nutshell, the rationalist project.
    - Tastes of Paradise, “With coffee, the principle of rationality entered human
physiology, transforming it to conform with its own requirements.”
    - Voltaire was a fervent advocate for coffee, and supposedly drank as many as
seventy-two cups a day.
    - produces a kind of animation that looks like anger: one’s voice rises, one’s
gestures suggest unhealthy impatience; one wants everything to proceed with the
speed of ideas; one becomes brusque, ill-tempered, about nothing. One assumes
that everyone else is equally lucid. A man of spirit must therefore avoid going
out in public.
    - In college I dated a woman who had grown up without a television in her home;
she missed so many references, jokes, and allusions that she sometimes seemed
vaguely foreign to us, and we to her.
    - Here’s what I’m missing: I miss the way caffeine and its rituals used to order
my day, especially in the morning. Herbal teas—which are barely, if at all,
psychoactive—lack coffee’s and tea’s power to organize the day into a rhythm of
energetic peaks and valleys, as the mental tide of caffeine ebbs and flows.
    - I miss being able to take part in coffee culture, idling in cafés and taking in
the scene. Even as the mind accelerates, the body slows and is perfectly content
to while away the time.

  Pink Highlights:
    - You begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the ones that
have most grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms of the 48 laws of
power, and you extract from them a lesson and an oath: “I shall never repeat
such a mistake; I shall never fall into such a trap again.” If you can evaluate
and observe yourself in this way, you can learn to break the patterns of the
past—an immensely valuable skill.
    - Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please
and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might
accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear
more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.
    - When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of
all.
    - “The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in
what one pays for it—what it costs us.”
    - All masters want to appear more brilliant than other people.
    - Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of
others—that is too high a price to pay.
    - They do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest invention ; they
care about their name and their glory
    - First you must flatter and puff up your master.
    - Remember the following: Never take your position for granted and never let any
favors you receive go to your head.
    - He did not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.

  Pink Highlights:
    - It was deeply uncomfortable
    - I wondered if I would ever get used to the temporal displacement.
    - sly grin
    - I thought about how selfish I was.                         I really hated
myself.
    - No one ever threw their arm over my shoulder the way Sohrab did. Like it was
perfectly fine to do that sort of thing to another guy. Like that was a thing
friends did to each other.
    - If Mamou made the best chelo kabob in the Alpha Quadrant, it was nothing
compared to her hugs, which were easily the best in the Virgo Supercluster, of
which our Milky Way Galaxy was only one small part.                         When
Mamou wrapped her arms around me, a whole new dimension of light and warmth
opened up between them.
    - I wished I could stay in Iran.
    - My ears burned.
    - I’d finally managed to open up the well inside me.                         I
didn’t think I could block it again.
    - “It’s just . . . everything I do, he’s unhappy with me. How I cut my hair. What
I eat. The backpack I take to school. My job. Everything. He’s always
disappointed in me. He’s always trying to change me. To make me do things the
way he would do them. To make me act how he would act.”
    - When Dayi Jamsheed started herding us together into a big group photo, my eyes
started burning. I couldn’t help it.                         I loved them.
    - I loved Sohrab.
    - Sohrab was still leaning against me, patting my shoulder.
“This is the nicest gift anyone has ever given me.”
Sohrab squeezed my shoulder again and rubbed the back of my head.
    - Dad rubbed my hair.                         He didn’t even comment on its
length.
    - perpetually
    - “Yeah. I love him too.”                         That may have been an
exaggeration.
    - It wasn’t true.                         How could he say that?
    - Stephen Kellner clearly didn’t understand my social standing at Chapel Hill High
School. He’d never had to deal with the Fatty Bolgers and Cyprian Cusumanos of
the world.
    - leviathan
    - Maybe I was learning to have less walls inside me too.
Maybe I was.
    - I almost felt handsome.                         Almost.
    - I didn’t know anything could make Sohrab blush.                         It made
me like him even more.
    - Normally, I enjoyed when Laleh did that. Being a pillow felt like the kind of
thing a big brother was supposed to do.                         I did not feel
like a very good big brother that morning.
    - It was loose and free, like he didn’t care who heard it.
    - “It’s fine,” Sohrab said. “Ali-Reza is like that. It doesn’t bother me so much.”
    - intricate
    - “Um.” My ears burned. “It was a pimple.”
    - garbled
    - “Proverbially speaking.”
    - I felt even more ashamed.                         Sohrab had been pretty much
fatherless for years, but here I was, complaining about Stephen Kellner who,
while imperfect, was certainly less terrifying than the Iranian government.
    - She says we’re just being self-conscious.
    - Stephen Kellner was a Paragon of Teutonic Masculinity.
    - Sohrab’s smile brightened into a squint. “Friends?”                         I
smiled too.                         It was impossible not to.
“Friends.”
    - It was like the well inside me had finally cracked open.
    - secular humanists
    - School was hard enough, being a Fractional Persian. I’m not sure I would have
survived being Even More Persian.
    - it was weird to get all the way naked. I had never taken my underwear off next
to another guy.
    - I felt very sorry for myself afterward.
    - But even as I laughed, I thought about how Mamou and Mrs. Rezaei and Sohrab had
danced this dance together before. How they had celebrated Nowruz together
before.                         How Mamou had kissed Sohrab on both cheeks and
invited him inside for tea before. More times than anyone could count.
My chest imploded. Just a little bit.                         I hated how Sohrab
had a larger share of my grandmother’s life than I did.
I hated how jealous of him I was.                         I hated that I
couldn’t make it through a Nowruz party without experiencing Mood Slingshot
Maneuvers.
    - Ardeshir Bahrami had always seemed severe to me, for as long as I had known him.
Even when I was a child and he was a scary figure on Mom’s computer monitor with
a gruff voice and a bushy mustache.
    - There was something deeply wrong about seeing Stephen Kellner embarrassed.
My own ears burned. Harmonic resonance.
    - And I knew Stephen Kellner was relieved to have another chance, a new child who
wouldn’t be such a disappointment. It was written across his face every time he
smiled at her. Every time he sighed at me.
    - Persians have mastered the ancient and noble art of the awkward family photo—in
fact, we probably invented it. True, Non-Fractional Persians refuse to smile in
photos, unless they are tricked into it, or have been talked into it with a
combination of pleading, guilt-tripping, and high-level taarofing.
    - I hated that Dad thought that about me.                         I hated that he
was right.
    - Darioush?”                         “Um. Yes?”                         “What is
wrong with your . . . penis?”                         My throat clamped up.
“Nothing,” I squeaked.                         Sohrab said something to the
other boys, in Farsi again, and they answered, more insistent.
Sohrab cleared his throat again. “It looks different?”
“Uh. I’m not circumcised?”
    - chameleon
    - affectionate
    - It was the most fun I had ever had.
    - Sohrab understood me.                         And I understood him too.
And it was pretty much the most amazing thing ever.
    - Sohrab’s backpack had exceeded the normal laws of space-time.
    - I couldn’t believe he looked like he was actually having fun.

    - Watch where you’re aiming,” Trent said. “Terrorist.”
    - Our very own Star Trek.
    - “He is Bahá’í. It’s not so good if you’re arrested and you’re Bahá’í. You know?”
    - tentative
    - I swallowed away the sand in my throat. My ears burned hotter than a
matter/antimatter reaction chamber.
    - equinox
    - My stomach tickled where Sohrab had grabbed me. I blushed.
No one ever stood right next to me like Sohrab did.                         I
wasn’t used to guys doing that.
    - What kind of name is Darius Grover Kellner?                         It was like

    - indiscretion
    - Standard Parental Maneuver Alpha.
    - I couldn’t take any more penile humiliation.
    - All I could think about was a hot cup of tea.
    - The sociopolitical landscape of Chapel Hill High School was treacherous enough
without giving people an excuse to pick on you.
    - like a warp core about to breach
    - I was only a Fractional Persian, after all.
    - This, despite Chapel Hill High School’s Zero Tolerance Policy toward sexism.
    - accretion
    - It seemed I had misread the situation between Sohrab and Ali-Reza, who had acted
like friends, but were clearly engaged in some sort of personal vendetta that
could only be settled through soccer/non-American football.
    - I almost smiled.                         Almost.
    - which meant she had enough fuel to power an electro-plasma system.
    - And I sat with Stephen and Laleh Kellner as they watched Star Trek.

    - Teutonic
    - epitome
    - “I don’t want to control him. He’s just so stubborn.”
    - “It’s not the same, though. Dayi Soheil thinks I’m fat. And Dayi Jamsheed says
I’m not Persian. But they like my dad. He’s in there playing Rook.” I hiccuped.
“Everyone is disappointed in me.”
    - I liked that about Sohrab. That he would wait for me to figure out what I wanted
to say.
    - They were both tanned and lean, their stomach muscles highlighted by the
reflection on their wet skin.
    - “I dunno. A while,” I said. “It’s genetic. Dad has it too.”
“But you don’t talk to him about it? When you are sad, like now?”
“No.”                         Sohrab chewed on his bottom lip.
    - nosy
    - You are so selfish. My father is dead and you come over to play football?
    - I tried to smile too, but my face felt weird and rubbery, and it came out as a
half smile, half-constipated look.
    - Evasive
    - “Yeah.” I hated that my voice still squeaked.
    - I felt terrible for using his nice cleats, but I couldn’t see any way out of it.
    - Sohrab’s laughter kept dancing around in my skull.
    - fiddled
    - decommissioned
    - inexplicable
    - I held out my hand, and he shook it, though it was loose and fleeting and felt
kind of weird.
    - who had made a joke about Mom’s accent.
    - Sohrab’s uncle turned his smile toward me. I didn’t think it was possible, but
it got bigger somehow.
    - Worse than mud, even: It looks like the sort of primordial goo that could
generate new amino acids, which would inevitably combine to initiate protein
synthesis and create brand new life forms.
    - unblemished

    - Hossein.                         The thing is, I never had a friend like Sohrab
before. One who understood me without even trying. Who knew what it was like to
be stuck on the outside because of one little thing that set you apart.
    - Zoroastrianism is patrilineal,

    - I loved who being Sohrab’s friend made me.
    - My neck started to prickle.                         I wanted to know about
growing up in Iran.                         I wanted to know what my cousins
were like when they were kids.                         I wanted to know what
Zandayi Simin had done with her life.                         My aunt was
offering me a treasure—a hoard of jewels, worthy of Smaug the Terrible (the
dragon, not the water boiler). And I was too paralyzed to reach out and select a
gem.
    - rested.                         “But it doesn’t matter. Darioush is Persian
too.”                         I was a warp core on full power.
I was glowing with pride.
    - Maybe Dad was right.                         Maybe I would always be a target.
Even for things I couldn’t help. Like being from America. Like having a
foreskin.
    - I decided to put my arm over Sohrab’s shoulder too, even if I felt kind of weird
doing it, and not just because of the sweat running down the back of Sohrab’s
neck.                         Sohrab was so comfortable touching me.
I liked how confident he was about that.
    - I thought I was having an anxiety attack.                         I had never
been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but Dr. Howell said that anxiety and
depression often went hand in hand. Comorbidity, he called it.
It was an ominous-sounding word.                         It made me anxious.
    - Mamou shifted and wrapped her arms around me. Her face was wet against my
shoulder.                         I hated that she was crying.
I hated that Babou had treated her like that
    - ubiquitous
    - I didn’t want to go home.                         I didn’t know what I was going
to do when I had to say good-bye.
    - callused
    - I felt very Persian indeed.
    - I wasn’t so sure I wanted to play anymore.                         But Sohrab
squinted at me, and the knot of nerves in my chest melted a little bit.
Some friends just have that effect on you.

I mean, guys are not supposed to love their little sisters. We can look out for
them. We can intimidate whatever dates they bring home, although I hoped that
was still a few years away for Laleh. But we can’t say we love them. We can’t
admit to having tea parties or playing dolls with them, because that’s unmanly.

  Blue Highlights:
    - compliment
    - It’s called being non-needy and an attractive man.
  Pink Highlights:
    - Some studies claim that body language accounts for as much of 60% of all
communication that occurs between two people. That’s a lot.
    - warts and all
    - aphrodisiac
    - You do this by making yourself vulnerable, sharing yourself unabashedly, and
polarizing her one way or the other and being comfortable with either result.
    - eliminate women who won't make you happy from your life. It's a blessing, not a
curse.
    - thereof
    - A man with an attractive and interesting lifestyle, a man with high standards
for himself and the relationships in his life, will take the time to get to know
an attractive woman before soliciting her with gifts. He will wait until he
feels strongly enough to genuinely give her a compliment. And if he talks to her
and discovers that there is little that is interesting about her beyond her
looks, then he will lose interest.
    - it’s OK. It’s OK to be rejected. It’s OK to make mistakes. It’s OK to say
something stupid. Don’t give up.
    - Remember, it’s “Fuck Yes!” or no. And if I’m not getting a “Fuck Yes!” then I’d
much rather have a no than a “Meh, OK.”
    - And of course, status is ultimately determined by demographics. At a college
house party, a burly 20-year-old kid who crushes beer cans on his head is going
to have a high level of status to the girls there. At an opening at a local art
gallery, he is going to have almost none. A skinny bass-playing hipster is going
to have
    - Our job is not to attract every woman, but to screen for women with a high
potential of being attracted to who we really are.
    - The only permanent way to attract and date more women and more attractive women
is to become more attractive yourself. And the way a man becomes more attractive
himself is by investing in himself, in becoming less needy.
    - The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to
the quality of your lifestyle, your social status, and your looks. The
percentage of women that you’re able to move from Neutral to Receptive will be
proportional to how good your “game” is, or how well you’re able to communicate
and express yourself with women. And your ability to sort through each type of
women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold
you are when it comes to meeting women.
    - What do you value in a woman? Honesty? Beauty? Affection? Intelligence?
Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Obviously, the answer is “all of the
above”, right? So let me rephrase the question: what do you value the most? What
is an absolute deal-breaker in the women you date? Prioritize what you look for
in a woman. This will help you decide where to look.
    - more power to you
    - Get your life taken care of. Get healthy. Find a happy group of friends. Find a
few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend
your time doing. This increases your self-investment and will make
    - tick to topics about her passions, move her from venue to venue, never sits
across from her but next to her, use a planned excuse to get her back to his
place, etc.
    - When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when you feel that she’s out
of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate
in your life, this sub-communicates the most powerful elements of attraction to
her.
    - The first step to being more attractive is to see rejection as a means to
    - Lifestyle, Courage, and Communication: I refer to these as the Three
Fundamentals.
    - “I was embarrassed. Yes, it sucked. Yes, I have issues. No, I’m not perfect.”
The implication being the whole time that I’m fine with it. I’m not looking for
sympathy or validation. I don’t need anything from her. It’s just who I am,
rough edges and all.
    - Everything he gives to her, he is giving with the expectation to receive
something in return. The drinks are not unconditional. They’re bought with the
provision that she stays and talks to him. The compliments are spoken with the
provision that she shows him affection in return.
    - If you don’t know what your passions and interests are, take a minute and write
down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never
worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get involved in that
activity or event in some way.
    - “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.”
He’s saying he is non-needy and high status.
    - Ask yourself this: why would you want to be intimate with someone who doesn't
appreciate you? Why would you ever settle for such a person? Because she's hot?
Come on, have a little more self-respect. Have some higher standards.
    - 1. Wear clothes that fit. 2. Wear clothes that match. 3. Dress to your
personality
    - “You read literature because you can never meet enough people.”
    - That’s because they’re showing how invested they are in your approval without
them actually knowing you, without them taking the time to connect with you and
understand you. And as a result, you don’t trust them. You find them creepy and
weird.
    - My boundary is established: I value curiosity, education, intelligence and
authenticity. I also don’t value “fake” looks such as pounds of make-up,
bronzer, hair extensions or super tight skirts.
    - A blunter way of putting it is: whether you realize it or not, the results you
get with women are always your fault.
    - high status at a local indie show and low status at a business-networking event.
A successful stock trader who wears Armani suits is going to have high status at
his firm’s annual Christmas party and little status at a hippy music festival.
    - “Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.”
    - The key is to 1) recognize your personal interests and strengths, and 2) build
upon those personal interests and strengths to quickly attract women in your
preferred demographic.
    - This willingness to walk away from her and this ability to accept nothing in
return is what gives my genuine interest so much value.
    - Women with the traits that you value, where do they frequent? Where are you most
likely to find them?
    - "What's your favorite thing in the world?"
    - When a compliment comes from a man seeking nothing in return, it’s a gift of
truth, a piece of his vulnerability and infinitely more powerful as a result.
    - Women are people too (radical idea, I know). And as people, we all value those
who genuinely value us, not expecting something in return.
    - A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman’s attention or affection
through entertainment, money or superficiality is a man who is not confident in
his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.
    - A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The less
